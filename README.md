*Introduction*

I am doing this case study to put to practice my new knowledge I've learned in Google Data Analysis Certificate Program. In this case study I will use two data analysis tools: SQL and Tableau.

This case study is about Cyclistic, a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.


Scenario

You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders.
Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

---Stakeholders and Team

-Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.
-Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.
-Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals—as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.

---I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act in order to answer the business questions.
